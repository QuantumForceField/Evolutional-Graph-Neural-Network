## Introductions
This library is created to simulate graph neural networks in a time-step manner. The library allowed users to create, configure, run, save, load and visualize graph neural networks, as well as simulate evolution process of the network by inheritance, and mutations.

As this library simulates graph neural networks in a time-based manner, neural networks with cycles are allowed to exist.
